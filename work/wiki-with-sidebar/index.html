                        The history of cosmetics spans at least 7,000 years and 
                        is present in almost every society on earth. Cosmetic 
                        body art is argued to have been the earliest form of a 
                        ritual in human culture. The evidence for this comes 
                        in the form of utilised red mineral pigments 
                        (red ochre) including crayons associated with the 
                        emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa.
                        [1][2][3][4][5][6] Cosmetics are mentioned in the 
                        Old Testament—2 Kings 9:30 where Jezebel painted her 
                        eyelids—approximately 840 BC—and the book of Esther 
                        describes various beauty treatments as well.

                        Cosmetics were also used in ancient Rome, although much 
                        of Roman literature suggests that it was frowned upon. 
                        It is known that some women in ancient Rome invented 
                        make up including lead-based formulas, to whiten the 
                        skin, and kohl to line the eyes.[7]

                    <h2>AFRICA</h2>
                    <h3>Egypt</h3>
                    <p> One of the earliest cultures to use cosmetics was 
                        ancient Egypt, where both Egyptian men and women used 
                        makeup to enhance their appearance. The first cosmetics
                         appeared 5,000 years ago in Egypt. To achieve a 
                         pleasant smell and softness of the skin, incense 
                         oils were used, and women applied white to protect 
                         their faces from the sun. The Egyptians were also the 
                         first to use black antimony-based paint as eyeliner. 
                         And to create a natural blush, crushed flowers were 
                         used.[8]

                    <p>
                        The use of cosmetics in Ancient Egypt is well 
                        documented. Kohl has its roots in north Africa. 
                        The use of black kohl eyeliner and eyeshadows in dark 
                        colours such as blue, red, and black was common, and 
                        was commonly recorded and represented in Egyptian 
                        art, as well as being seen in Egyptian hieroglyphs. 
                        Ancient Egyptians also extracted red dye from 
                        fucus-algin, 0.01% iodine, and some bromine mannite,
                        [vague] but this dye resulted in serious illness. 
                        Lipsticks with shimmering effects were initially 
                        made using a pearlescent substance found in fish 
                        scales, which are still used extensively today.[9] 
                        Despite the hazardous nature of some Egyptian 
                        cosmetics, ancient Egyptian makeup was also thought 
                        to have antibacterial properties that helped prevent 
                        infections.[10] Remedies to treat wrinkles contained 
                        ingredients such as gum of frankincense and fresh 
                        moringa. For scars and burns, a special ointment was 
                        made of red ochre, kohl, and sycamore juice. An 
                        alternative treatment was a poultice of carob grounds 
                        and honey, or an ointment made of knotgrass and 
                        powdered root of wormwood. To improve breath the 
                        ancient Egyptians chewed herbs or frankincense which 
                        is still in use today. Jars of what could be compared 
                        with setting lotion have been found to contain a 
                        mixture of beeswax and resin. These doubled as 
                        remedies for problems such as baldness and greying 
                        hair. They also used these products on their mummies, 
                        because they believed that it would make them 
                        irresistible in the after life.

                    <h2>ASIA</h2>
                    <h3>CHINA</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Flowers play an important decorative role in China.
                        Legend has it that once on the 7th day of the 1st 
                        lunar month, while Princess Shouyang, daughter of 
                        Emperor Wu of Liu Song, was resting under the eaves 
                        of Hanzhang Palace near the plum trees after 
                        wandering in the gardens, a plum blossom drifted down 
                        onto her fair face, leaving a floral imprint on her 
                        forehead that enhanced her beauty further.
                        [20][21][22] The court ladies were said to be so 
                        impressed, that they started decorating their own 
                        foreheads with a small delicate plum blossom design.
                        [20][21][23] This is also the mythical origin of the 
                        floral fashion, meihua zhuang[21] (梅花妝; literally 
                        “plum blossom makeup”), that originated in the 
                        Southern dynasties (420–589) and became popular 
                        amongst ladies in the Tang (618–907) and Song 
                        (960–1279) dynasties.[23][24]

                    <h2>EUROPE</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Cultures to use cosmetics include the ancient Greeks[5]
                        [6] and the Romans. In the Roman Empire, the use of 
                        cosmetics was common amongst prostitutes and rich 
                        women. Such adornment was sometimes lamented by 
                        certain Roman writers, who thought it to be against 
                        the castitas required of women by what they 
                        considered traditional Roman values; and later by 
                        Christian writers who expressed similar sentiments 
                        in a slightly different context. Pliny the Elder 
                        mentioned cosmetics in his Naturalis Historia, and 
                        Ovid wrote a book on the topic.

                        Pale faces were a trend during the European Middle 
                        Ages. In the 16th century, women would bleed 
                        themselves to achieve pale skin. Spanish prostitutes 
                        wore pink makeup to contrast pale skin.
                        [citation needed] 13th century Italian women wore 
                        red lipstick to show that they were upper class.[26] 
                        Use of cosmetics continued in Middle Ages, where the 
                        face was whitened and the cheeks rouged;[27] during 
                        the later 16th century in the West, the personal 
                        attributes of the women who used makeup created a 
                        demand for the product among the upper class.
                        [vague][27] Cosmetics continued to be used in the 
                        following centuries, though attitudes towards 
                        cosmetics varied throughout time, with the use of 
                        cosmetics being openly frowned upon at many points 
                        in Western history. In the 19th century, Queen 
                        Victoria publicly declared makeup improper, vulgar, 
                        and acceptable only for use by actors,[28] with many 
                        famous actresses of the time, such as Sarah Bernhardt 
                        and Lillie Langtry using makeup.

                    <h2>THROUGH THE CENTURIES</h2>
                    <h3>19TH CENTURY</h3>
                    <p> 
                        During the late 1800s, the Western cosmetics industry 
                        began to grow due to a rise in “visual self-awareness”,
                         a shift in the perception of color cosmetics, 
                         and improvements in the safety of products.[31] 
                         Prior to the 19th century, limitations in lighting 
                         technology and access to reflective devices stifled 
                         people’s ability to regularly perceive their 
                         appearance. This, in turn, limited the need for a 
                         cosmetic market and resulted in individuals 
                         creating and applying their own products at home. 
                         Several technological advancements in the latter 
                         half of the century, including the innovation of 
                         mirrors, commercial photography, marketing and 
                         electricity in the home and in public, increased 
                         consciousness of one’s appearance and created a 
                         demand for cosmetic products that improved one’s 
                         image.[31]

                    <h2>MEN IN MAKEUP</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Men have had a long history with cosmetics, 
                        and have been beautifying since 50,000 BCE.
                        [citation needed] In the 1970s, male musicians 
                        began to use makeup onstage. This included famous 
                        rock stars such as David Bowie, Alice Cooper, and 
                        the band Kiss. The use of cosmetics allowed them to 
                        create an alter ego, and were part of the visual 
                        entertainment of their shows. Currently, the 
                        popularity of TikTok has created a rise in men’s 
                        cosmetics. Some men have chosen to wear nail polish, 
                        makeup, and other cosmetics to express their 
                        identity online.
