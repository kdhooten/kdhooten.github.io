            <b>Graphic design</b> 
            is a profession,
            <sup>[2]</sup> 
            academic discipline
            <sup>[3]</sup>
            <sup>[4]</sup>
            <sup>[5]</sup>
            and applied art whose activity consists in projecting visual 
            communications intended to transmit specific messages to social 
            groups, with specific objectives.
            <sup>[6]</sup>
            Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of design
            <sup>[1]</sup>
            and of the fine arts. Its 
            practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using 
            manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics 
            to communicate visually.

            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is 
            that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. 
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the 
            compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to
            convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone 
            expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a 
            demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally 
            or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic 
            message into a graphic manifestation.

        <p>
            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the term
            "graphic design" in a 1922 article,
            <sup>[14]</sup>
            although it appears in a 
            4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a 
            publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article 
            about technical education for printers:
            <sup>[15]</sup>

        </p>
        <p>
            An Enterprising Trades Union
            … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails 
            among printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of
            design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and
            develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
        </p>
        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the California 
            School of Arts & Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic Design 
            and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and 
            Lettering. Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer.

        <h4>Main article: History of graphic design</h4>

        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion 
            of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, the 
            distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art 
            has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, 
            practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client. 
            In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and 
            services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to 
            information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts 
            that document the human experience."
            <sup>[17]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively 
            recent concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. 
            Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic design
            emerged, some date it back to the Interwar period. Others understand
            that it began to be identified as such by the late 19th century.
            <sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            It can be argued that graphic communications with specific purposes
            have their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and the birth of 
            written language in the third millennium BCE. However, the 
            differences in working methods, auxiliary sciences, and required 
            training are such that it is not possible to clearly identify the 
            current graphic designer with prehistoric man, the 15th-century 
            xylographer, or the lithographer of 1890.

            
        </p>
        <p>
            The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic 
            manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only 
            recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an 
            industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been 
            "projected" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, 
            ergonomic, contextual, among others.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and 
            profession has been closely linked to technological innovations, 
            social needs, and the visual imagination of professionals.
            <sup>[18]</sup> 
            Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout 
            history; in fact, good examples of graphic design date back to 
            manuscripts from ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. As printing and 
            book production developed in the 15th century, advances in graphic 
            design continued over the subsequent centuries, with composers or 
            typographers often designing pages according to established type.
            <sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct 
            profession in the West, partly due to the process of labor 
            specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new 
            technologies and business possibilities brought about by the 
            Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation
            of the design of a communication medium (such as a poster) from its
            actual production. Increasingly, throughout the 19th and early 20th 
            centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and magazines 
            hired art directors who organized all visual elements of 
            communication and integrated them into a harmonious whole, 
            creating an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922, 
            typographer William A. Dwiggins coined the term graphic design to 
            identify the emerging field.
            <sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout the 20th century, the technology available to designers 
            continued to advance rapidly, as did the artistic and commercial 
            possibilities of design. The profession expanded greatly, 
            and graphic designers created, among other things, magazine pages, 
            book covers, posters, CD covers, postage stamps, packaging, brands, 
            signs, advertisements, kinetic titles for TV programs and movies, 
            and websites. By the early 21st century, graphic design had become 
            a global profession as advanced technology and industry spread 
            worldwide.

            Graphic design can have many applications, from road signs to 
            technical schematics and reference manuals. It is often used in 
            branding products and elements of company identity such as logos, 
            colors, packaging, labelling and text.

            From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of 
            opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful 
            compositions of visual information – known as information design. 
            With the advent of the web, information designers with experience 
            in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the 
            background to news stories. Information design can include Data and
            information visualization, which involves using programs to 
            interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, 
            and can be tied in with information graphics.

            A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of 
            existing text, ornament, and images.

            The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights 
            the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and 
            by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. 
            The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs 
            which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; 
            communication as an agent.
