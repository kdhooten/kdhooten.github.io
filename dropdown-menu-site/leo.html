            <p>Meet Leo, the adorable gray Miniature Schnauzer with a heart 
                of gold! This pint-sized pup packs a whole lot of personality 
                into his small frame. With his distinctive salt-and-pepper 
                coat and perky ears, Leo is a true head-turner. Don't let his 
                size fool youâ€”Leo is full of energy and loves to explore the 
                world around him. Whether it's accompanying you on a brisk 
                morning walk or snuggling up on the couch for a cozy movie 
                night, Leo is always up for an adventure. He's incredibly 
                smart and eager to please, making him a breeze to train. 
                Leo is hoping to find a forever family who will cherish him 
                as much as he'll cherish them, offering endless love and 
                companionship in return. Could you be the lucky one to welcome 
                Leo into your home?</p>
